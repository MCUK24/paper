#Introduction
This is my introduction which is very brief but its something to do with biomass aerosols over west africa or something like
that.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) previously showed that there was something inportant going on in this region. 
But continental scale measurements have not previous been made. 

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which
measurements can be made on a regional scale actually.

#Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported
away from the course region.
